### Option 2 - Online Data Analysis
*[Remove this section if you are **NOT** choosing Option 2.]*
> Students may develop their own programming project. In this option, students must identify a source of online data, which will be dynamically imported via Python. The Python code must utilize these data to either make decision support recommendations or provide a detailed analysis of the data. A YouTube video describing the mechanics of the Python code will be required, in addition to a “how-to” guide for running the code. All source code must be submitted, and the course instructor must be able to execute the code without errors.

#### Data Sources
- *[Provide a description of each data source you plan to use.]*
    - *[For each data source, provide a link to the API documentation.]*

#### Analysis Plan
- *[Clearly explain the analysis you will conduct with the data.]*
- *[Clearly justify how the chosen source data will enable your team to conduct this analysis.]*

#### Motivation
- *[Explain why you have chosen to conduct this analysis.  What is it about this data that interests you?]*
